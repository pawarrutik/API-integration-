*DESCRIPTION*:

Project Title: Weather App

The Weather App is a responsive, interactive, and visually engaging web application that allows users to check real-time weather information for any city worldwide. Designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches weather data from the WeatherAPI.com and dynamically displays it in a clean and animated user interface. This project is ideal for showcasing skills in web development, API integration, and responsive design.

Core Features:

User Input & Search: The app includes a text input field where users can type the name of any city. Upon clicking the "Get Weather" button, the app fetches and displays real-time weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description of the weather condition, along with a representative icon.

Predefined & Random City Buttons: To enhance user experience and reduce manual input effort, the app includes quick-access buttons for popular cities like Mumbai, Tokyo, and New York. Additionally, there's a "Random" button that automatically selects a random city from a predefined list, making the app interactive and engaging.

Reset Functionality: The Reset button clears the input field and the displayed weather results, allowing users to perform a fresh search without page reload.

Real-Time API Integration: The app utilizes the WeatherAPI to retrieve current weather data based on city names. The JavaScript fetch() function is used to send asynchronous requests, and the results are parsed and dynamically injected into the HTML structure.

Error Handling: The app includes proper error messages such as "City not found" or "Error fetching data" when the user enters an invalid city or if the API fails to respond.

UI & Design: The user interface is crafted with attention to both aesthetics and usability: The background uses a gradient color scheme that animates smoothly to reflect a dynamic and pleasant visual experience. All components, such as input fields, buttons, and the weather display box, are responsive and stylishly designed with rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects. Fonts are imported from Google Fonts (Poppins) for a clean, modern appearance.

Technical Stack:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3

Styling: Custom CSS with animations and transitions

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and API integration

API Used: WeatherAPI.com

Learning Outcomes:

This project is a practical demonstration of: DOM interaction using JavaScript REST API usage and error handling Event-driven programming Clean, responsive UI development with CSS Enhancing user experience through interactivity

Use Case: This Weather App is an excellent tool for beginners and intermediate developers to understand how real-time data-driven applications work. It can be further extended by adding features like 7-day forecasts, map integration, temperature unit conversion, or even saving favourite cities.
